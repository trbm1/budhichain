# budichain
This project enables building React-based applications on top of the DeSo blockchain using low-code platforms like Budibase, along with modern state management tools like Recoil and React Query. The app focuses on performance, caching, and modularity while integrating DeSo blockchain data seamlessly.

# Features
* DeSo Blockchain Integration: Fetch and manage DeSo blockchain data using React Query for efficient caching and background fetching.

* Low-Code Development: Utilize Budibase for rapid frontend development while integrating custom React components and DeSo API calls.

* State Management: Manage UI and user state with Recoil, and handle remote data with React Query.

* Custom Components: Build dynamic components (e.g., geometric shape generators) that interact with DeSo data.

* Mobile & PWA Support: Optimize for mobile devices and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with responsive design and local caching.

* Deployment Flexibility: Deploy the app to platforms like Vercel, Firebase, or custom servers.
